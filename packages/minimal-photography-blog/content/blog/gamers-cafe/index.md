Saturday mornings kids come socialize in a safe, supervised environment.

Bring your console, Switch or PSP and game in the TTL Makerspace with others. Or use our PCs, break out the boardgames from the ample supply in the Sharing Depot, and enjoy good times with friends. This is a recreational club.

In the Junior Gamers Cafe, kids come and enjoy socialization and gaming in-person rather than online. Our lead mentor ensures a safe, respectful environment, and our approved games are vetted to ensure they are kid-friendly and safe for all.

Newer players can get matched up with appropriate gaming partners, or play with the gaming mentors as they learn to develop both their technical skills, and their social skills.

The Junior Gamers Cafe runs in 7-week sprints in order to provide consistent mentorship and create opportunities for developing friendships in the program.

### Who is this for?

Kids who love to game! This is a casual environment, closely monitored by mentors to ensure everyone has fun gaming together in-person. We ensure kids play well together, and inject healthy breaks to promote socialization and good gaming habits.

Come in your pyjammas, and grab a bowl of cereal\* - we're about to do some gaming!
