Men's Shed is a program of the Alzheimer Society that provides men in early stages of the condition with a place to socialize while building projects.

The name Men's Shed was coined by the Australian Men's Shed Association, referring to the tradition of men having a garden shed in which they could seek solace and carry out practical tasks.

The goals of the program include:

- Encouraging better physical and mental health
- Reducing isolation, loneliness, and depression
- Supporting men through difficult times, such as illness, relationship changes, and early retirement
- Providing empowerment opportunities to contribute to the local community
- Creating friendships

### Details

This is an 8-week program where men living with early to mid-stage dementia can socialize and collaborate on woodworking projects or small repairs. Join us for two hours of hands-on activities in an informal context where you can meet other people, learn, and mentor in groups with other men.

**Please note that experience with woodworking is not required to take part in the program**

**Time:** 10:00am to 12:00pm

Please wear comfortable footwear. Light refreshments are provided.
