Men's Shed is a program of the Alzheimer Society that provides men in early stages of the condition with a place to socialize while building projects.

This is an 8-week program where men living with early to mid-stage dementia can socialize and collaborate on woodworking projects or small repairs. Join us for two hours of hands-on activities in an informal context where you can meet other people, learn, and mentor in groups with other men.

**Please note that experience with woodworking is not required to take part in the program**

Light refreshments are provided.
