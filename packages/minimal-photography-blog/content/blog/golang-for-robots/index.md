Go is the exciting, powerful language created by Google and stirring up development. Join your guide in learning the Go programming language by programming robots! Sensors, motor-control, IOT, and data-visualization will be explored in-depth.

Go is one of the most interesting, and in-demand programming languages to come along in recent times, because it is open-source, and makes it easy to build simple, reliable, efficient software for multiple platforms.

The Go language sits mid-way between low-level system applications and higher level applications.

In this fun and unique introduction to Go, we'll use the language's amazing ability to compile for multiple platforms to create software capable of controlling hardware and devices.
