A guided introduction to the world of reductive CNC prototyping using the Omni CNC Mill and the software Vcarve. Learn the basics of designing and programming basic computerized cuts on this amazing machine.

**This is a 2 Week Course!**

The workshop will take place over two weeks, Mondays, from 6-9pm. After completion of the course a 1 hour test will be booked at your convenience with the instructor. Completion of this course and the test will give participants independent access to the CNC Router to do basic cut operations\*.

The class will cover the following:

- CNC Machine Safety and Operation
- Creating Basic Tool Paths from a given file in VCarve (Contour, Pocket and Engraving)
- Cutting Tool Paths on the CNC Router that were made in VCarve

NOT COVERED in Class: Geometry/Vector creation in V-Carve

There is a lot to cover in this class. For best use of time this will happen offline and will provide links to tutorials if one chooses to use it for their 2D. V-Carve will accept vector files from many other programs. I will provide the class with a simple 2D file to use.
