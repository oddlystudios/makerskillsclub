Join the Junior Worldbuilders as we travel to deep space, plunge deep underwater, burrow underground and build castles in the desert.

Themed world-building using a favorite tool - Minecraft, but expanding to a variety of platforms like Roblox, Factorio, Kerbal Space Program, and Space Engineers. Together we’ll take journeys to deep space, visit underwater realms, explore lost civilizations, and build fantastic worlds.

Along the way, the Junior Worldbuilders will learn real skills like working with graphics and modelling. They’ll learn about environmental design and balanced ecology. With guidance from instructors, they’ll practice online etiquette and learn to work together, share responsibilities, and communicate.

For those who want to take their technical skills to the next level, the Junior Worldbuilders provides a foundation for Unity Game Dev.
