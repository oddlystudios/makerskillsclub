Join the Junior Worldbuilders as we travel to deep space, plunge deep underwater, burrow underground and build castles in the desert.

Themed world-building using a favorite tool - Minecraft! Together we’ll take journeys to deep space, visit underwater realms, explore lost civilizations, and build fantastic worlds. This club involves hardware, crafting, software skills, design and creativity.

To begin, members pick up technical skills in a fun way by building their own gaming box from a Raspberry Pi development board. They'll learn to manage an operating system, install and manage software, and get their own installation of Minecraft up and running.

Along the way, the Junior Worldbuilders will learn real skills like working with graphics and modelling. They’ll learn about environmental design and balanced ecology. With guidance from instructors, they’ll practice online etiquette and learn to work together, share responsibilities, and communicate.

For those who want to take their technical skills to the next level, the Junior Worldbuilders provides a foundation for Unity Game Dev.

## Club Activities

**Build a Gaming Box!**

Using the well-known Raspberry Pi single-board computer, members will learn to:
