Get up to speed with laser cutting! Learn to create designs and prep them for use on the Lasersaur laser cutter in a fully functional laser-cave. This design workshop gets you certified to book time and use the laser on your own.

Our Makerspace's Lasersaur is a highly capable and safe 100-watt open source carbon dioxide laser cutter. In trained hands, the Lasersaur is customizable to achieve varying degrees of etching and cutting on a wide variety of materials. Inkscape is a free and open-source cross-platform vector graphics editor.

This workshop is suitable for the absolute beginner and guides you through preparing your own vector graphic design file in Inkscape and setting up the machine for optimal laser cutting from start to finish. We will look at examples of projects completed with our laser cutter and discuss best practices and tips.

**Please bring a laptop with the latest version of Inkscape already installed and working**
