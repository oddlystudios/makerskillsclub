Interested in 3D printing and wondering if it is for you? Got an idea you would like to try out? Learn the basics and some of the most common gotchas for a smooth transition into additive prototyping with 3D printing.

Join our 3d printing experts for a 3 hour class. All you need to know to get started designing and printing. This class will certify you to use our fleet of "Ender3" 3D printers.\*

Our Makerspace's 3D printers can print a wide variety of materials and colors.

This workshop is suitable for the absolute beginner and guides you through preparing your own 3D design file using Tinkercad, Slicing your design using Cura and setting up the machine for printing from start to finish. We will look at examples of projects completed and discuss best practices and tips.

You will bring home a 3d printed object of your own making.

**Please bring a laptop with the latest version of Cura already installed and working**
