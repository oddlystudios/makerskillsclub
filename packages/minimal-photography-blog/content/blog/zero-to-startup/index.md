Guided by diverse experts, learn to identify markets, brainstorm creative solutions, and work as a team to rapidly prototype solutions. This club takes you from beginning to the seed of your startup.

The Zero-to-startup program is a popular format that teaches problem-solving, prototype development, and team-based achievement in an entrepreneurial environment.

In this program, students work in a startup environment. They’ll propose community-based challenges to work on, and with guidance from experienced mentors work to develop solutions to those challenges. They learn to assign and work with roles, pick up the technical skills to prototype and test their ideas.

Industry guests feature prominently in this programming, making appearances to share their experiences from a variety of fields of expertise.

In addition to prototyping technical solutions, students learn to plan, prepare, and communicate their ideas. They’ll learn what makes a compelling pitch, and refine their presentation skills through practice and guidance.

This ten-week program builds to a final presentation of both the challenge and the solution to a panel consisting of industry professionals.
