Ready to dive into real game development? Learn to use the powerful, versatile Unity platform to design, program, and publish your very own games. This club gets you from start to finished game.

Game development is one of the very best ways to introduce the more technical aspects of STEAM learning - an entry to physics, game theory, programming and art all in one. The Unity game platform provides an incredible foundation for designing and building games, and in this course game developers learn to write code, create models, use sound effects, and compose games starting with the classics from the golden age of the arcade, right up to modern 3D worlds.

Weâ€™ve had incredible feedback from this program. For returning developers, the program introduces new game styles, new skills, and additional challenges to level up with. For beginners, it provides foundational knowledge that they can continue to build on again and again.
